# Sign-Prediction

Dataset Used : Slashdot Dataset

SlashDot Dataset:  Slashdot is a technology-related news website. In 2002 Slashdot introduced the Slashdot Zoo which allows users to tag each other as “friends” or “foes.”  The semantics of a signed link is similar to Epinions, as a friend relation means that a user likes another user’s comments, while a foe relationship means that a user finds another user’s comments uninteresting. Slashdot dataset has a data of 82,144 users and 549,202 edges of which 77.4% are positive. 

Other dataset that could be used: Wikipedia,Epinions

Two models have been created for the sign prediction problem (Degree-prediction &  triads).
